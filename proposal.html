	            <h1>PROPOSAL.</h1>


	           <p>	My digital story will use the original sketch I created when designing my personal logo, a ghost, as the main character. The ghost has stuck to me throughout my college years as I still feel undiscovered within myself. The ghost represents some kind of mystery, not only personally, but with outside experiences. Not only will this story be an ode to self-reflection, but serve as a commentary on my opinions of the capitalist ideology, working until retirement or death.</p>

	           <p>	The story will begin with a younger, possible teenage ghost character. The ghost will remain gender neutral, to serve as a closer connection to universal experience. The story starts with the ghost at their first job, a simple, sketchy illustration of the character working a service job. The format will be a click-through story, with an arrow in the bottom right signaling the next page. There may be small animations throughout each page, and potentially short dialogue to represent their inner thoughts. Each page will show the character working a different job, showing their lack of confidence in each thing they try. The first pages will show minimum wage jobs such as a food delivery driver, barista, sales associate positions, and receptionist. These jobs are taken from data showing the most common jobs held by teens as well as jobs I have had myself. </p>

	           <p>	To remain open-ended, there will never be a reason the ghost holds so many positions throughout his lifetime. The idea is to create a dream-like space, almost as if the ghost is accounting miserable memories, a lack of confidence in choosing a final career, or a career that is of a dream, never actually possible. The story will continue with pages of illustration where the ghost is pictured at many more jobs. Every 10 pages, there will be a physical change to their appearance, signifying aging.</p>

	           <p>	Here is a list of jobs the ghost might hold, again unknown to the reader why, how, and when this position was acquired. This is just a list of thoughts.</p>

	           <p>[artist, architect, engineer, zookeeper, accountant, astronaut, dentist, doctor, nurse, biologist, deep-sea diver, politician, teacher, graphic designer, management of some kind, pop star, dancer, actor, stay-at-home caregiver, dog walker, vet, town hall member, bus driver, taxi driver, psychologist, professor, criminal justice, farmer, fashion designer, talk-show host, soccer player, maid, director, activist, baker, etc.]</p>

	           <p>	If the main character is the only ghost, the other characters that would support the story will be abstract-shaped beings. All illustrations would be created with pencil and paper, Illustrator, and Procreate. If I decide the rest of the characters are also ghosts, the main ghost will be plain, as the rest will have a special distinction connecting them to the job they belong to. This will be another visual connecting these characters to their job, making it a permanent part of their being.</p>

	           <p>And now for the ending. Well, this ghost character has been humanized, creating sympathy and showing a visual process to the difficulty of finding a fitting career. The ghost does not reach retirement, but falls ill due to the stress of living a life of isolation. The last pages we see our ghost in a hospital bed, dying of their illness, and the nurses calling out the time of death. Next, to follow the humorous irony of the entire story, the first nurse says</p>

	           <p>Wait. They are a ghost, aren't they always dead?</p>

	           <p>The ghost reawakens. The last page shows the ghost back to work.</p>
